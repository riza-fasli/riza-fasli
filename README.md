Portfolio(https://portfolio-riza-fasli.vercel.app/)

I build production ready full stack applications and deliver seamless user experiences at scale. My work spans real world systems, high quality client projects, and tools used across multiple countries.

I have created and shipped impactful projects, including:

- **Image Adjuster Online** - a widely used online image processing tool used in 30+ countries
- **Full stack platforms** built with modern architectures and deployed for real users
- **Complete client solutions** designed, developed, and optimized for performance

I am continuously building new products, expanding into advanced technologies, and sharpening my problem solving skills on LeetCode.
